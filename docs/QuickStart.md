# Vulkan2D Quickstart
Vulkan2D (VK2D) is a 2D/3D renderer written in C with Vulkan for small 2D games. It is
simple enough to use, but of course there is this guide to help with some of the details.

## The Basics
Everything that will be mentioned in this guide is mentioned in greater detail in the
documentation for any given function. Feel free to generate the doxygen docs or simply
read the header file containing the function for more information. The functions of
interest to the average user will be `vk2dRenderer*`, `vk2dTexture*`, `vk2dPolygon*`,
`vk2dCamera*`, `vk2dModel*`, and `vk2dShader*`.
